                <h1>About Me!</h1>
     
                <p> My name is Jomarie Dela Cruz, and I am a Grade 12 student at Tala High School, specializing in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) strand. As a senior high school student, I am passionate about exploring the world of technology and learning how it shapes the modern world. My interest in ICT drives me to develop my technical skills and knowledge, preparing me for future opportunities in the field. I am always eager to learn new things and apply my knowledge to real-life situations.
               </p>
     
               <p>
                Outside of school, I like to play basketball, which has long been one of my favorite pastimes.  In addition to keeping me active, basketball teaches me important life values like perseverance, discipline, and collaboration.  I firmly believe in putting up my best effort and remaining dedicated to my objectives, whether I'm on the court or in the classroom.  I've gained time management skills and a strong work ethic by juggling my education and my love of athletics.
               </p>
               <p>
                My goal as I proceed through Tala High School is to develop both intellectually and personally.  The prospects that the ICT strand presents and the ways in which it may pave the way for future technological jobs fascinate me.  I want to make the most of my senior year of high school, keep getting better, and confidently take on new challenges.  I am excited for the future and honored to be a member of a learning community that promotes development and excellence.
