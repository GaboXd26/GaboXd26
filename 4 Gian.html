                <h1>About Me!</h1>
     
                <p> Hi, I’m Gian Mark P. Fresnido, a 17-year-old from Tala, Caloocan City. I was born on November 11, 2007, and I’m someone who loves to keep things light and fun. I enjoy spending my time doing things that make me happy, whether it’s playing video games, scrolling through reels, or just having a good laugh with friends.
               </p>
     
               <p>
                Gaming has always been one of my favorite hobbies. It’s not just about winning; I love the excitement and challenge that comes with it. When I’m not gaming, you’ll probably find me watching reels online. I enjoy keeping up with the latest trends and funny videos — they never fail to brighten my day.
               </p>
               <p>
                I like to think of myself as a pretty easygoing person. I enjoy making people laugh and having conversations that keep the mood upbeat. Life’s too short to be too serious all the time, so I try to enjoy every moment and make sure the people around me do too.
               </p>
