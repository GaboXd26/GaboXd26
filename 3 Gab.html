            <h1>About Me!</h1>
 
            <p> Hi I'm Antonio Gabriel S. Terencio, but you can call me "Gab" in short, I'm 17 years old turning 18 this august. I am currently a graduating senior in Tala High School, my strand is ICT which is all about technology and advancement. Throughout this whole senior high school life I experienced and learn many things both good and bad, right and wrong, which helped me grow as a person and find myself. My motivation really is my family, love ones and friends they inspire me to do better and be better for my future. 
           </p>
 
           <p>
            Enough of my school journey now let's talk about my childhood and what it's like growing up, first I grew up in a household where my real father isn't a very good father to us, that is why I'm very lucky to have a loving and caring mother and a stepfather, which I recognize more as my father than the real one, he is very hard working, caring, kind. He is not just a "stepfather" but the father who stepped up. Currently he is living in Japan with our grandmother and grandfather. And to my mother who is also very hardworking and always cared for us, thank you, I owe my life to you!
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, let's talk about my self, me as a person, I'm very softhearted and easily swayed by my emotions. Sometimes I might say that I don't care, but deep down I know I really do. I really like helping people even though it's hard, it is somewhat rewarding in a sense that, I made their day a little better, and that's it.
           </p>
