            <h1>About Me!</h1>
 
            <p> My name is James Warren Prito, and I am a 17-year-old student currently attending Tala High School. I am in Grade 12, specializing in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) strand as part of the senior high school curriculum. My academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding, as I continue to develop my technical skills and prepare for future opportunities. With a strong interest in technology and digital innovation, I am eager to expand my knowledge and apply it in real-world situations.
           </p>
 
           <p>
            Beyond academics, I enjoy spending my free time on hobbies that allow me to relax and unwind. Watching anime, reading manga and manhwa, and playing online games are some of my favorite activities. These hobbies not only entertain me but also allow me to explore different stories and cultures, fostering my creativity and imagination. Whether it's immersing myself in an action-packed anime series or competing in online multiplayer games, these activities bring balance to my life and keep me engaged.
           </p>
           <p>
            Looking ahead, my dream is to secure a decent job that will allow me to support myself and, one day, build a happy family. I am committed to working hard and staying focused on my goals to create a bright and stable future. With my passion for learning and determination to succeed, I am confident that I can achieve my aspirations while continuing to grow as an individual. Each step I take brings me closer to realizing my dreams and living a fulfilling life.
