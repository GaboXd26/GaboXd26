                <p> Hello! Iâ€™d love to share a bit about myself. Here's a glimpse into who I am and what makes me, well, me!
               </p>
     
               <p>
                  My name is Mikka M. chavez grade 12 student, I am 17 years old. My b-day is aug 17 2007 I live in tala caloocan city. In my free time I enjoy watching movies and anime because they allow me to experience different stories and perspectives. Whether it's a thrilling action movie or a thought-provoking anime, these forms of entertainment provide a fun way for me to unwind and escape into exciting worlds.

               <p>
                In addition to watching movies and anime, I also enjoy reading and drawing. Reading lets me learn new things and explore different stories. Drawing is fun because it helps me show my ideas and imagination. Both activities allow me to relax, stay inspired, and keep my mind engaged.

               <p>
                As a member of my family, I also like to help by doing chores around the house. it's important to contribute and support my family. Whether it's cleaning, cooking, or taking care of other tasks, I try my best to pitch in. Doing chores teaches me responsibility and helps keep our home organized.
