                <h1>About Me!</h1>
     
                <p> My name is Jedric Gitalla, and I’m 18 years old. I’m a student studying Information and Communications Technology (ICT). I love learning about how technology works and how it affects our lives. I’m still getting better at my skills, but I enjoy exploring different parts of ICT, like programming, fixing problems, and networking. I believe technology is important in our daily lives, and I want to keep learning so I can use what I know in the future.
               </p>
     
               <p>
                Besides studying, I like playing video games and trying new things. I enjoy discovering new technologies and learning new skills. I like spending time alone because it helps me focus and be creative. However, being shy makes it hard for me to talk to people and socialize.
               </p>
               <p>
                Sometimes, my shyness makes it hard for me to express myself, which can affect my schoolwork. I find it tough to speak up in class or ask for help, but I’m trying to get better at this by pushing myself a little at a time. I know that building my confidence will help me in school and in my future job. Even with these challenges, I am determined to grow and improve myself every day.
